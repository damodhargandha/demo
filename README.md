# demo
this is a demo repository
i want to change someting from the master branch. As the master is the main source code. if you want to make any changes 
a branch is required so that the new branch will create a screenshot of the master code and it can be changed and requests to pull request.
after changing the code we need to merge this barnch to the master branch.
